# Coffee Shop OOP

Welcome to the **Coffee Shop OOP** project! This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using a coffee shop analogy. The goal is to explain key OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction by modeling a coffee shop business.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Class** = Coffee Recipe  
   The blueprint for making coffee drinks. A class defines the ingredients and the method to brew the coffee.

2. **Object** = Your Actual Cup of Coffee  
   An object is an instance of the class, representing an actual cup of coffee made using the class blueprint.

3. **Encapsulation** = The Secret Sauce of Your Coffee  
   Encapsulation ensures that certain details (like coffee strength) are hidden from the outside world. It protects the internal state and allows changes only through specific methods.

4. **Inheritance** = Coffee Family Tree  
   Inheritance allows new coffee types (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) to inherit the basic recipe (class) but with unique additions or modifications.

5. **Polymorphism** = Same Coffee, Different Sizes  
   Polymorphism allows a method (e.g., `make_coffee()`) to behave differently depending on the size or type of coffee being brewed.

6. **Abstraction** = Keeping Coffee Orders Simple  
   Abstraction simplifies the process for the customer, hiding the complex brewing details and providing an easy interface for ordering coffee by name.
